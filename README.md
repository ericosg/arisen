## 📜 Description

> From the dead you rise. As a banished Dark Ages necromancer, command wave-based auto-battles of undead legions to stave off an alien insectoid invasion and preserve humanity.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- **Turn-based auto-shooter & auto-mover**  
  - You set up armies, skills & items between turns.  
  - Each turn contains multiple waves of combat; brief interludes let you cast spells (replenish Dark Energy, reanimate fallen, empower undead).  
- **Necromancy core**  
  - **Reanimate** any organic corpse into undead:  
    - **Skeletons** (1 / 1)  
    - **Zombies** (1 / Y)  
    - **Spirits** (X / 1, flying)  
  - “Finality counters” govern how many times an undead can return.  
- **Alien threat**  
  - Hive-mind insectoids (ground & flying) swarm medieval Earth.  
  - Humans (civilian + military) must survive—if population hits 0, you lose.  
- **Progression & mastery**  
  - Level up your MC to increase base/max Dark Energy (DE).  
  - Skill trees specialize in:  
    - Mass armies (cheap skeleton swarms)  
    - Durable tanks (zombie heal & damage boosts)  
    - Aerial strike forces (spirit upgrades, flying/Reach interactions)

## 🚀 Features
